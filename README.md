# AiiDA Enhancement Proposals (AEPs)

This repository contains enhancement proposals for the AiiDA project (AiiDA enhancement proposals = AEPs), similar to PEPs of the python process but a bit less 'formalized' and hence a lot closer to theway the [Jupyter project deals with enhancement proposals](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).

The purpose is to publicly discuss new features/design choices in the AiiDA ecosystem and to document the decision making process.
